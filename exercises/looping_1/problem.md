# LOOPING: 1

Write a program that invokes `console.log` 7 times, each time outputting
the character `'#'`.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

## HINTS AND STEPS

Create a file called `looping-1.js` in `my-solutions` to hold your
solution code.

This is a stepping stone toward the "Looping a Triangle" exercise
from _Eloquent JavaScript_.

When you are done writing your program, run

`$ {appname} verify my-solutions/looping-1.js`

to test your work.
