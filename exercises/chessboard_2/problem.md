# CHESS BOARD: PART 2

> When you have a program that generates [a chessboard], define a variable size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.

â€”Chapter 2, _Eloquent JavaScript_

Set this new variable to `10` in your completed program when verifying.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

## HINTS AND STEPS

Create a file called `chessboard-2.js` in `my-solutions` to hold your
solution code.

You'll need to adjust your `for` loops to make this work.

When you're done, run

`$ {appname} verify my-solutions/chessboard-2.js`

to test your work.
