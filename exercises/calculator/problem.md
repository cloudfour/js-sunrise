# CALCULATOR

Write a program that that writes the value of the following computation
to the console:

> Round the value of: 5 divided by the _remainder_ of 6 divided by 4,
then raise the (rounded) result to the power of 3.

## HINTS AND STEPS

Create a file called `calculator.js` in `my-solutions` to hold your
solution code.

You should be able to do this in one line of JavaScript code. There will
be a goodly amount of parentheses. You should be able to accomplish all
of this with the following:

* Basic JavaScript arithmetic operators
* Methods on the `Math` object
* `console.log`

When you are done writing your program, run

`$ {appname} verify my-solutions/calculator.js`

to test your work.
