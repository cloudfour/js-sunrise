# WELCOME TO CLOUD FOUR SUNRISE JAVASCRIPT

Write a JavaScript program that prints 'Hi from Portland!'
to the `console` (stdout).

------------------------------
## HINTS AND STEPS

Welcome to Sunrise JavaScript!

To make a Node.js program, you create a file with a `.js` extension and put
JavaScript in it.

Create a file called `welcome.js` in the `my-solutions` directory.

You can write to the console just like you can in a browser:

`console.log('foo');`

When you are done writing your program, run

`$ {appname} verify my-solutions/welcome.js`

Your solution will be tested automatically and we'll let you know how it went!

If your solution is correct, this lesson will be marked as `[COMPLETED]`.
