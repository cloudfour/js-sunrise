# FUN WITH STRING FORMATTING

Write a program that logs the following two-line string (exactly)
to the console:

```
Funny four times I didn't see the cat
As if I wanted \t not to. \\"Rock ON," she said.
```

----------------------------------------------------------

## HINTS AND STEPS

Create a file called `string_format.js` in `my-solutions` to hold your
solution code.

Make sure to review how to handle escaping in JavaScript strings.

When you are done writing your program, run

`$ {appname} verify my-solutions/string-format.js`

to test your work.
