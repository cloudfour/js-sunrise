# FIZZBUZZ: PART 1

> Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

â€”Chapter 2, _Eloquent JavaScript_

## HINTS AND STEPS

Create a file called `fizzbuzz-1.js` in `my-solutions` to hold your
solution code.

First, how can you loop through the numbers 1 to 100?

During each loop iteration, how should you decide what to print to
the console?

Still stumped? I've left a few extra clues in

`exercises/fizzbuzz_1/extra-hints.md`

When you're done, run

`$ {appname} verify my-solutions/fizzbuzz-1.js`

to test your work.
