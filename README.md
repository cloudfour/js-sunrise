# JS Sunrise Adventure for Cloud Four Folks

This repository is a combination of two things:

* Curriculum and materials based heavily on [_Eloquent JavaScript_](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Martijn Haverbeke
* Interactive node tutorial in the style of [nodeschool](http:http://nodeschool.io/)

## How To Use

At some point, I hope to have this `npm`-packaged so you can install it
globally using `npm install --global`. For the time being as it is under
construction, you'll want to do the following:

1. clone the repository
2. read the lesson material on github (it's easier to navigate that way)
3. run the interactive exercises

**NOTE**: Until this is a globally-installed odule, you will need to run the
interactive workshop slightly differently than the documentation within the
workshop describes. Instead of `js-sunrise` you'll need to use
`node js-sunrise.js`.

For example, `js-sunrise verify solution.js` would be
`node js-sunrise.js verify solution.js`
